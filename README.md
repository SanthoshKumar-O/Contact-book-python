#  Contact Book - Python CLI App

This is a simple Python-based Contact Book that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and search contacts . It also saves data permanently using JSON so your contacts are safe even after restarting the program.

##  Features

- Add new contacts
- View contact numbers
- List all saved contacts
- Delete contacts (with confirmation)
- Add more numbers to existing contacts
- Search for contact by number
- Auto-save & load contacts using JSON

##  How it Works

Your contacts are stored in `contacts.json`. Every time you run the app, it loads the data, and any changes you make will be saved automatically.

##  Run Instructions

```bash
python contact_book.py
